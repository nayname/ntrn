To set up an interchain query to fetch the total supply of OSMO from Osmosis once per day, we need to use the "register_bank_total_supply_query" message from the `ExecuteMsg` schema. This message is used to register a query to obtain the total supply of specified denoms from another chain.

Here is how the message should be structured based on the provided schema:

```json
{
  "register_bank_total_supply_query": {
    "connection_id": "YOUR_CONNECTION_ID", // Replace with the actual connection ID to the Osmosis chain
    "denoms": ["OSMO"],                     // Specify the denom to query
    "update_period": 86400                  // Set update period to 1 day (86400 seconds)
  }
}
```

- `connection_id`: This should be replaced with the actual connection ID that connects your contract to the Osmosis chain.
- `denoms`: An array specifying the denominations you want to query. In this case, ["OSMO"] is used.
- `update_period`: The interval in seconds at which the query should be updated. For once per day, this should be 86400 seconds.

Ensure to replace `"YOUR_CONNECTION_ID"` with the actual connection ID specific to your setup. This message should then be executed within the contract environment to set up the desired interchain query.
