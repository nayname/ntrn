# Technical Design Document: Ensuring Determinism and Reliability of LLMs 

## Project Overview

The primary objective of our project is to enhance the determinism, reliability, and overall accuracy of large language models (LLMs), especially tailored for mission-critical applications (beginning with smart contract generation). This document outlines the methodologies, strategies, and technical processes we employ to achieve these objectives.

## Automated Smart Contract Generation

Our initial application is automated smart contract generation, addressing key barriers like determinism and security in blockchain environments. We aim to reliably convert natural-language intents into executable smart contract code.

## Technical Approach

### 1. Determinism and Accuracy Improvement Techniques

To ensure that LLM outputs meet stringent accuracy standards, we implement several key strategies:

-   **Data Synthesis:**
    
    -   Generation and curation of targeted training datasets to capture diverse scenarios and edge cases. Datasets must be generated and manually labeled by blockchain experts.
        
-   **Quantitative Benchmarking (inference):**
    
    -   Establishing accuracy metrics by benchmarking LLM outputs against meticulously prepared datasets to improve LLM response. 
        
	-   **Prompt Engineering:**
    
	    -   Optimizing prompts to improve LLM outputs through iterative experimentation and feedback cycles.
        
	-   **Fine-Tuning:**
    
	    -   Customized fine-tuning of pre-trained models on domain-specific data to enhance reliability and determinism.
- **Agent-based architecture (inference):**
    -   Agents automatically enforce retries, schema validations, and structured error-handling logic, thereby significantly reducing unpredictable model outputs and improving reliability.

- **Model Context Protocol (inference):**
    -   MCP standardizes interactions between agents and external systems (static analysis tools, validators, benchmarks), enforcing explicit contracts and schemas. This structured communication layer further ensures consistent, deterministic behavior across system components.
        
-   **Static Analysis of Generated Outputs (post-inference):**
    
    -   Employing static code analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities, logic errors, or inconsistencies in generated smart contracts. Post-inference techique to controll LLM response.
        
-   **Post-validation and Human Supervision (post-inference):**
    
    -   Implementing robust post-validation mechanisms, including minimal expert validation, to ensure outputs adhere strictly to industry standards.
  
        

### 2. Data Strategy

-   **Public Data:**
    
    -   Leveraging openly accessible smart contracts, blockchain code repositories, and technical documentation to create extensive reference datasets.
        
-   **Private Data:**
    
    -   Collaborating with blockchain specialists to synthesize proprietary datasets, capturing detailed user intents, custom requirements, and specialized use-case scenarios.
        

#### Contract-specific Data Collection

For each smart contract category, we systematically collect:

-   **Smart contract scenarios** different use cases for clients smart contracts with corresponding intents.
-   **Accuracy metrics** for distinct scenarios.   
-   **Binary indicators** denoting suitability for reliable auto-generation or manual validation for each scenario.
-   **Fine-tuning schemas** optimized per contract type. JSON configs as a context for LLM.
-   **User feedback and interaction outcomes** for continuous improvement.
